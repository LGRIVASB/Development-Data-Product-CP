<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The next project is a simple linear regression Shiny app. The app is part of the Developing Data Products in Coursera.
You can find the code here: </p> 

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p> The app has 3 section. The first one is the <strong>general description and instruction</strong> tab. 
The second one is a <strong>data exploration</strong> tab where you can explore 3 different dataset and the last tab is <strong>model visualization</strong> 
there you can build a linear regression model.</p>

<h3>Data Exploration</h3>
<p>This section you can explore the datasets. In the selection panel, you can choose the dataset and the number of the observation that will display the application.
Then clic on the <em>View Data</em> button to refresh the visualization.</p>
<p>The main panel is going to show the general description of the selected data, the summary and a table with the
number of observation that you want to see.</p>
<p> The available dataset are:</p>
<ul>
<li>mtcars</li>
<li>iris</li>
<li>swiss</li>
</ul>

<h3>Model Visualization</h3>
<p>Here you will have a selection panel that has 3 drop-down list. To create your model follow the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the dataset that you want to use</li> 
<li>Select the predictive/independent variable</li> 
<li>Select the outcome/dependent variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main panel is going to display the summary of the model with the variables that you selected before. Additionally, the table of the coefficient of the fitted model
and the scatter plot with a red line which is the linear regression model.</p>
